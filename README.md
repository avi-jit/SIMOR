This project is developed and maintained by [Avijit Thawani](https://avi-jit.github.io/) and Kian Ahrabian, and is based on an amazing lit review tool by [Eshaan Aggarwal](https://www.github.com/EshaanAgg).
It also wouldn't have been possible without the [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api), [Notion API](https://notionapi.readme.io/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)!
